# betme

This is for the bet.me programming task 

We will use mongoose and mongodb as this is what Im most familiar with (and who the fuck actually likes SQL !?) 
please note by database/middleware skills are rusty as I've been working mostly in blockchain and frontend - yes this is my excuse for when I fuck up ! 

I will spend around 2-3 hrs in this task 


hr 0 - 0.5 
lets choose the tech stack that I will be using 
- Mongodb (as I hate sql) this I will host on Mongo's services for ease 
- moongose to help with the database managment on the middleware side 
- express to easily a restful server that will easily interact with my database- 

hr 0.5 - 1 
- I set up the basic project using this tutorial i found as a basic template https://rahmanfadhil.com/express-rest-api/

hr 1-2
lets start adapting from the tutorial 
- first let start by saving the database password into dotenv (will also be useful later to save api keys)
- now lets figure out how the sports api works 
- realised that node-cron should be used instead of express 
- set up node cron 
- set up the models 
- figured out how to update the database 

hr 2-3 
- put it all together 
- note this is still incomplete as the updates for inplay mactches dont happen with a given parameter 
- but run out of time so this will have to do
